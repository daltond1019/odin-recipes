    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Indian curry is the best food known to man, and Tikka Masal is my favorite. Essentially just a deliciou tomato sauce, this curry recipe calls for chicken, but you can substitute any protien. In fact you should experiment with this recipe. Curry is a canvas to be played with. For instance this recipe calls for only 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, but you can add more if you like a nice kick.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar, or more to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon curry powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat ghee in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook and stir just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, ginger, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, and turmeric into onion mixture; fry until fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir tomato sauce into onion and spice mixture; bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. Simmer sauce for 10 minutes, then mix in cream, 1 tablespoon sugar, and paprika. Bring sauce back to a simmer and cook, stirring often, until sauce is thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Stir chicken into hot oil; add curry powder. Sear chicken until lightly browned but still pink inside, about 3 minutes; stir often.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken and any pan juices into sauce. Simmer chicken in sauce until no longer pink, about 30 minutes; adjust sugar and salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve hot preferably over rice.</li>
    </ol>
